## PowerShell?

> Ultimate PowerShell Guide

PowerShell is a standardized automation and management scripting framework built on .NET. Not only can it natively manage the Windows OS, but it now is the behind the scenes management glue of Microsoft’s popular platforms like Active Directory, Exchange, Azure, and more. In addition, other major IT vendors like VMware and NetApp have created PowerShell modules for managing their solutions, turning PowerShell into a universal glue for managing Windows-based IT environments.

When I write a script in PowerShell to accomplish a task, I accomplish three things:

1. I make the process efficient. What may take minutes to perform manually, the PowerShell solution can complete in seconds.
2. I make the process consistent. By incorporating decision logic and configuration choices, the PowerShell solution will output consistent results, removing opportunity for manual error.
3. I make the process repeatable. Whether performing a task once or a hundred times, the PowerShell solution will repeatedly give me the efficiency and consistency I need, and I can turn the solution over to IT Operations with input parameters and expected output, without requiring expertise knowledge of HOW it works.
